         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To which your Subject, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring his natural and legal Allegiance to your Sacred Majeſty, boldly anſwered, <hi>That he was ſoon reſolved what courſe to take in that buſineſs, without any ſtudy; for that he would by no means diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey your Majeſties Proclamation, in ſubmitting his Arms to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments devotion:</hi> and beſides, informed them all openly, <hi>That by the Common and Statute Lawes of this Kingdom, it was High Treaſon to levy Armes againſt the King.</hi> Which aſſertion of the Truth they little eſteemed; but affirmed notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they would all ſend their Armes, and that it would fall heavy upon your Subject, if he refuſed to do the like. But your Subject knowing a good Conſcience in Adverſity, to be more pleaſant, than a treacherous heart in Proſperity, little regarding their Judgements, but reſolved, if the will of God were ſo, to ſuffer rather for well doing, than for evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And though your ſubject thinks himſelf unworthy to take in hand the legal defence of your Majeſties Right, yet when he heard their irreligious, and undutifull Diſcourſe, tending to the ſlighting and undervaluing of your Majeſties Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the applauding only of the Parliaments Deſigns; your Subject was ſo jealous of your Majeſties Juſt Royalties, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives, and Reputation, that he freely reprehended their folly, and told them they were too confident in their conceits, That the Parliament were many of them but weak men, and might fall into groſſe errors: That it was not to be imagined, that all the wiſedome in the Kingdome, was now ingroſſed to the Houſe of Commons; for it was able to afford many thouſand Aſſemblies as wiſe as they: That Truth onely muſt be the ſquare of Chriſtian mens acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51849:19"/> and not the fantaſtical and factious opinions of men: and among other Paſſages alſo ſaid unto them, That they profeſſed themſelves to be haters of Idolatry, and yet it appeared they were much infected with Superſtition, a grand limme thereof; for they had as Reverend a conceit of their Parliament, as the Papiſts have of the Pope, which is, that he cannot poſſibly erre in his Function.</p>
            <p>Within a few dayes after came Warrants to Town, to command all our Armes compleat, to beat <hi>Colcheſter</hi> the next morning. The Conſtable came preſently to warn me, to ſend my Armes accordingly. I asked him to ſee his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, which he ſhewed me; and when I had read it, I told him, That he knew my mind already, for I had declared it ſufficiently at the laſt Town meeting He confeſſed, that I had ſo done, yet he muſt come to do his Office. Then I asked him, If his Authority concerning this matter were derived from under your Majeſties Great Seal. He anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, No, it was from the Parliament.

               </gap>ſtable he was. He replyed, That I was a merry Gentleman to ask him ſuch a Queſtion, and that I my ſelf knew better than he whoſe Conſtable he was, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to his Office. I anſwered him, That indeed I have thought I had known ſomething, but now the Lawes are ſo ſtrangely refin'd, that my Learning is almoſt out of date: But I prethee, ſaid I, tell me in good earneſt whoſe Conſtable thou art? He anſwered, The Kings. Then quoth I to him, Thou art a very Foole; for the word of God ſayth, <hi>His Servants ye are to whom ye obey;</hi> and therefore you having no Authority from the King, but doing the contrary to his Royal command, are ſurely the Parliaments Conſtable, and none of the Kings: Whereat his Conſtableſhip was at a Nonplus. Then I told him, that I intended to certifie to the Captain, the Reaſons under my hand, why I refuſed to ſend my Armes: That if I offended the Law therein, they ſhould then have my own hand-writing for a Witneſs againſt me. The next morning I wrote to the Captain to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, That ſuch a Warrant had been ſhewen unto me, but withall, that I had formerly ſeen your Majeſties Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and further intimated, that I ſhould be heartily ſor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51849:20"/> give a juſt occaſion of offence to others that were in ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate power: but I remembred that long ſince I had taken the Oath of Allegeance, and therefore (were it but in that regard) how I could diſpence with my ſelf in Diſobeying His Majeſties Royal Proclamation I did not yet well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, but my Armes and Bodie were ever ready to defend his Majeſties Royal Perſon and Honour. This Letter was delivered him in the open Field amongſt the Trained bands, where were preſent divers Parliament men, which I dare ſay had a ſight of it: but I heard little thereof; only the next week I going to <hi>London,</hi> Newes was brought home, that ſo ſoon as I came at my Chamber, I was apprehended, by Order from the Parliament, and laid in Priſon, and ſhould be fined as much as my Eſtate was worth; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe I refuſed to ſend my Armes at the laſt Traine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But it was but a falſe Fire to terrifie my Wife and Children, and to affright others from their duty and allegeance. Then at my return home, the Parſon of the Pariſh told me, That he heard I was like to fall into trouble, and that he was ſorry I had not done as my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours did: I anſwered him, That I was not ſorry at all, for I had done as my Conſcience, and the Law directed me: But, quoth he, there will come danger of it: Gods will be done, ſaid I, for I am reſolved to be conſtant, and never to turn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, for I ſhall ever account it an honour to ſuffer in my Princes Quarrell; and would fain ſee the face of that man, that durſt call me in Queſtion for ſhewing my true allegeance to my Soveraign. Afterwards I was threatned to have my houſe pulled down, and all my goods taken away by Riflers, who ſaid they had an Order ſo to do, becauſe I would lend no money to the Parliament.

No, ſaid I, for I have no moneys to lend; but had I never ſo much, yet I think I am able to make it appear to you, or any man that is of an impartial Judgement, why I ought not to lend money to ſuch a deſign; but now a dayes, ſaid I, men muſt not ſpeak the truth, what they think:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51849:20"/> whereat he clapped his hand upon his breaſt, and ſaid thus, Before God I dare not ſpeak what I think my ſelf. After, he asked What means was uſed to procure money in our Country? I told him, The Miniſters perſwaded much; but, ſaid I, every thing that Parſons now ſpeak in the Pulpit, doth not work upon honeſt mens Conſciences, that ſmell of Loyalty and Diſcretion. After this I was too often troubled with their Warrants, either about lending of moneys, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Armes, or their nugatory politick Aſſociation, ſtill roaring in my ears with an Ordinance of Parliament; and ſtill I told them, That theſe doings at length would make the Ordinance roar in the Field. And I thank God I was ſo far from obeying any of their Warrants, that I ſtill gave them this anſwer, That by Gods grace I would never do my ſelf or poſterity that wrong, to live or dye a Rebell; and that all their projects would ſurely come to nought, and tend to nothing but miſchief in the end; ever Harping upon this ſtring, That it was without all queſtion High Treaſon to levy Armes againſt the King, &amp;c. and ſundry times I have labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to convince them by Gods word, and alſo read to them the Statutes and other Reports of the Law, and Hiſtories, which I did think moſt fit to rectifie their Judgements; and though it did them little good, yet I truſt that therein I did diſcharge my Conſcience and duty towards God and your Majeſtie. And ſoon after the Battle at <hi>Edgehill,</hi> when your Majeſties Forces came towards <hi>London,</hi> the Conſtable of our Pariſh came late in an evening, and charged me to ſend away my Armes the next morning, with a months pay; I asked to ſee his Warrant, wherein it was ſpecified, that we ſhould ſend our Armes to oppoſe your Majeſties Army; whereat I told him, That his Warrant was ſomewhat too plain, for there was no mention of Cavaliers or Malignants, but pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily his Majeſties Army: Then quoth he, ſure that word is miſtaken; Yes, ſaid I, you run too much upon miſtakes, but you might have ſpared the labour of comming to me, for you know my mind well enough. But, quoth he, a man is not alwayes of one mind, 'tis not fitting he ſhould: Yes, ſaid I, if a man be an honeſt man it is not fitting he ſhould turn Knave; and for my part I will never meddle in this Rebellion, for if I ſhould, my Conſcience would accuſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51849:21"/> me for an arrant Traytor: But, ſaid he, what Anſwer ſhall I make to the Deputy Lieutenants: Why, quoth I, you may tell them, that I have ever been a true Subject to my Prince, and ſo I am reſolved to continue; and I will alſo be obedient to all ſubordinate powers under the King, ſo long as they hold their Allegiance to his Majeſtie, but if they waive their Obedience to the King, then muſt they give me leave to forſake them; for Armes or Money I will never ſend, to oppoſe his Majeſtie, or any that take his part, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I be chopt in pieces for it, and that is mine Anſwer. Not long after came another of the Conſtables to my houſe, with a Warrant to ſearch all houſes for Armour, which I peruſing, ſaid unto him, That his Warrant was generall, but I believed that my ſelf was the only man in the Pariſh that he aimed at; Yet, ſaid I, as the Caſe ſtandeth, I am not bound by Law to obey this Warrant, neither will I: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe becauſe I have heard that ſome idle people have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that I have great ſtore of Armes in my houſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to take away thoſe fears and jealouſies from you. I will (though not in obedience to your Warrant, yet in point of Neighbourhood) let you ſee what Armes I have, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I carried him into every room in my houſe, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to ſearch where he pleaſed, but nothing he could find to take any exceptions at, for indeed I had no Armour at all, but that I was formerly charged to find: Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Treacherous Villain went ſoon after to the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lieutenants of the Shire, and certified them that I was a moſt dangerous man, and had Armes in my houſe for at leaſt 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> men, and that if my Armes were not taken from me, I would be ready upon any occaſion to do much miſchief. Whereupon Order was given that a Trained band ſhould be raiſed to diſarm me; who ſoon after <hi>Christmaſs</hi> 1642. in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He told me that he was come again to ſearch for Armes; Why ſo? ſaid I,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51849:21"/> you have done that already; Ay but, quoth he, we have a Warrant to apprehend your body; Nay then, quoth I, take it if thou canſt get it; With that a Parliament Captain that was hidden behind the Pales, ſhewed himſelf, and ſaid, Sir open your doors, for we muſt have ye: Sir, quoth I, thou art like to tarry a while: Upon which denyal, the Souldiers that were Ambuſcadoed about the houſe, began to appear, and cryed, Give fire; whereat there rattled ſuch a peal of Muſquets againſt the houſe, as were alone enough to have converted a Coward to the Round Religion; whereat my little Boyes ſtarting out of their beds to dreſſe themſelves, the Bullets peircing into their Chambers, did beat the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of the walls about their faces, inſomuch that the Eldeſt, but 14. years of age, came running to me, and ſaid, O Father they ſhoot Bullets, let us ſhoot at them again, although we die for it every one of us; But the Father had no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Force, to equal the Childs Valour, and therefore thought it no policy to provoke ſuch obſtinate hare-braind Rebells, and it was Gods great mercy that I was ſo patient, for they reported themſelves afterwards, that if we had but ſhot off a Gun, we had been all killed, and the houſe pulled down. Again I went to the Window, and askt them what they intended? They preſented their Muſquets and Piſtols at the very face of me, and charged me to open the doors: I replyed, That if they had any Authority from the King, I would; They ſaid, No, but they had order from the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament; To that, quoth I, I will not yield; Then they ſaid they would break the houſe: I wiſhed them to be adviſed, for my houſe was my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aſtle, and I was in the Kings peace, and if they did any more then Law would juſtifie, they muſt look one day to hear of it: Then as faſt as they could they broke open all the doors, ſeized upon me, ſearched every Trunk and Cheſt in my houſe to find Plate, tumbled about my Bedding and Apparell, with their Muſquets in their hands, and Matches light, took away all my Armour and Weapons, leaving me not ſo much as a Rapier, and forcibly carried me away, ſaying, that for ought they knew I might be charged with Treaſon; for theſe ſots think every man a Traytor, that abhorreth to be ſo As we rode along the Captain wiſhed me to ſubmit: I ſaid that I had not offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51849:22"/> the Law, and therefore would make no ſubmiſſion: For theſe riotous Rebells, ſaid I, that have abuſed me and my houſe, have greater reaſon to make a ſubmiſſion then my ſelf. When we came at the place where theſe Deputy Lieutenants were, much people was aſſembled on a Green before the houſe, to ſee what ſhould become of this horrible Malignant; then iſſued they out to examine me, before the multitude, where it was laid to my charge, that I refuſed to ſend my Armes to the Trainings; 'Tis well known, ſaid I, that I have ever been as ſedulous to ſend them as any man, till now of late: But there is now moſt need, ſaid they; I anſwered, That his Majeſties Proclamation commanded the contrary, and when there is an Order for it under his Majeſties Great Seal, then will I ſend my Armes, before I will not: Then was I charged for not contributing to the Parliament; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That your Majeſtie had declared that none of his true Subjects ſhould furniſh the Parliament with Horſe, Armes, or Money, and that I had rather offend all men living, then the King of <hi>England,</hi> or my own Conſcience: Then it was urged, That I ſaid I would march to the King; Why, ſaid I, if my own houſe grow too hot for me, whither ſhould I go for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection but to my Soveraign. But, quoth one, there be a great many of Raſcalls with the King; Sir, ſaid I, take heed what you ſay, for you call in queſtion the beſt and wiſeſt men in <hi>England,</hi> for I am ſure they are with the King. Then one cried out, That I had ſaid the then Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was a Traytor: I replied, His Majeſtie had proclaimed him ſo, and as my Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught me, I doubted that he would hardly anſwer his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Then ſaid one, that I had called the Miniſters Pulpit-Knaves: I anſwered, that I did in my heart reverence all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Divines, but ſuch as now a daies came up to preach Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to abuſe the King and his Liege people, I knew ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place more fit for them then a Pulpit. Then ſaid one in the crowd, You are in the way to Hell: But I having a better teſtimony within me, laughed at him, and ſaid, I hoped better things: But, ſaid I, (ſtanding cloſe by the Deputy Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, the Captain and Souldiers hemming me in) here is a brave Company about me, what do all theſe people intend to guard me thither? at which ſome could not refrain from
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51849:22"/> laughing; and ſo the terrible Examination ended. Then the Gentlemen requeſted me in, and uſed me civilly, (though ſome of the Raſcalls had much abuſed me) and after much diſcourſe, they wiſhed me whatſoever I thought, yet to be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of my Speech, for they ſaw my Neighbours were maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But God be praiſed for it, I had ſtill the teſtimonie of mine own conſcience to comfort me, in the midſt of theſe our ſad calamities, that I had wilfully done no wrong to any man: For indeed that very thing for which the people eſteemed me to be their worſt enemy, was the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt manifeſtation and moſt infallible ſign of my ſincere love, beſt affection, and faithfull friendſhip towards them, in the

I anſwered him, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I ſtood up in my Pew being ſo near the Pulpit, I could not chuſe but eſpy his Directory, or Devils ſtory lie ſtill in his Desk, and I could not endure to behold ſuch an uggly and deformed Imp of ſchiſme and ſedition: and then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto me, that if it offended me I might take it away if I pleaſed; not ſo quoth I, for it is a parcell of your Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches goods, and ſo I may be queſtioned for committing of Sacrilege, I will by no means ſoul my hands by medling with it, but if it lies there long, I will not come at the Church: the next time I went, the bable was gone, and departed down I think to the place of darkneſſe where it was firſt hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, for I never ſaw any more of it.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51849:53"/> that, I was bound in conſcience not to betraie his caſe, but to urge on his behalf what I did conceive was moſt availeable for him, ſo far as Law or equitie did warrant me; and that it was a rare thing to hear of, that a Counſellor at Law ſhould be called in queſtion for his care and induſtrie in the lawfull and honeſt pleading of his Clients buſineſſe, which is the true performance of the truſt repoſed in him: and thus that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection as it ſeemed was paſſed over, but the main matter which they infiſted upon, was my ſonnes being in armes in <hi>Colchest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> charging me that I had furniſhed him with horſe, armes and monie, to go upon that deſign. I anſwered, that indeed he had gotten a little monie at a place, where it was due unto me, but it was all taken from him, long before that he came at <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> and with arms I could not furniſh him, for they were all taken from me, at the time when my houſe was firſt plundered; and horſe I had none of mine own, neither durſt I keep anie for divers years before: and ſo at length after much diſcourſe and altercation the reſult and ſum of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe was, that I muſt enter into a bond of 500 l. to leave off and diſcontinue all ſuch actions as I had commenced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe, that had taken the profits of my lands by force and colour of ſequeſtration: and this <hi>volens aut nolens,</hi> I was enforced to yield unto, or elſe I muſt ſtill abide in priſon, and there ſtarve, for ought that I then knew: and when I had ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Bond, after ſome conſultation amongſt themſelves, ſome of them ſaid unto me, that now if I would pay the troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that had fetched me thither, I might go home for that time, ſo as I would not refuſe to appear upon a new ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. I anſwered, that I had not monie to pay the troopers, but you Gent. ſaid I, that did ſet them at the work have a large purſe, and therefore I hope that you will pay them their wages: at laſt with much adoe I got off, but I beleeve the reaſon was becauſe they could not poſſibly got that from me, which then I had not for my ſelf: and ſo by the mercie of God, I came well home again, to the great comfort of my poor familie, being all full glad that I had thus eſcaped the tirants hands, although it were upon hard terms: and for a while after we remained in reaſonable quiet, and having by our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie gathered together a little monie, we ventured to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51849:53"/> chaſe a Cow, which long we had not enjoyed, but there came Troopers and took her away, for non-payment of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſements, for indeed I had not paid any as yet during all the time of the then fore-paſſed Rebellion; and now the driving away of this Cow, which had been ſo hardly obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo long time a purchaſing, was a ſad diſaſter, and did more vex us then the loſſe of a hundred times as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when we had plenty, and truly it made my little Daughter to weep bitterly, and that cut my heart, to ſee that I could keep nothing for the ſuſtenance of my poor Children, and eſpecially was I grieved for her ſake whom not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had reproved, for endeavouring to learn to ſpin, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her, that I would not have her to dirty and defile her ſelf with ſuch greaſie work; and her anſwer was as well as ſhe could, being ſcarce old enough to ſpeak aright, that ſhe had rather ſpin then ſtarve; and theſe things I remembred to my grief, but knew not how to help my ſelf, untill it pleaſed God to ſend a remedy: And now alſo the Troopers threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to come again, and fetch away our Houſhold ſtuff that was left, if they could find no other diſtreſſe. Theſe ſad troubles, and imminent dangers did much perplex me, and I was almoſt at a ſtand how to diſpoſe of my ſelf, and my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; my Loyalty and Courage did ſtill prompt me to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all hazzards, but my tender compaſſion towards my dear Wife and Children, did work wonders upon my reall, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Royal-reſolution, and they earneſtly intreated me, that if I would by no means meddle in the matter my ſelf, yet to give them leave to uſe ſome means to pay the rates, for without payment thereof, they well perceived they could never enjoy any thing in quiet; and hereupon I ſadly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with my ſelf, that for our ſins our Princely Pilot was then taken away, and we all in danger of imminent ſhipwrack, and little likelihood left of that relief which we ſo long had hoped for and expected; and therefore though with much reluctation, I yielded my conſent unto them, to do what they thought beſt; and upon this my Wife and my Son did ſeek a way to redeem their Cow, but by the occaſion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers arrears incurred ſince I had laſt entred upon my Land, the redemption of the Cow did coſt them more then ſhe was worth 3, or 4. times over. And now the people about

               </gap>fully to wait for a better opportunity; and thus for a year or two we continued, without any great trouble, and then having by mine own induſtry, and the help of ſome Friends, attained a ſmall quantity of money, I did begin to intend the reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my houſes, being very ruinous, and in great decay; but I had not far proceeded in this ſo neceſſary a work, but there was a new Alarum in the Diurnals of an Act made to fell away my Eſtate, and the common report was, that I had now no remedy at all to help my ſelf, but was then paſt all recovery, for my Eſtate muſt be ſold away, and all my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany left Beggars: Hereat my Wife did much reluct, and wiſhed that I had never laid out any money about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of my houſes, for quoth ſhe, they were too good for the Rebells before; Be content, Sweet heart, ſaid I, it is for my credit to keep my houſes in a gentile manner, and thoſe that ſhall enjoy them will have the better conceit of me, and I hope without doubt to ſee ſome better dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I dye. Soon after there came three men from <hi>London</hi> to my houſe to ſurvey my Eſtate, and theſe took notice how many Rooms there were in the houſe, and how many Trees were growing upon my ground, and among much diſcourſe, they asked me if I had not been a Captain in the Kings Army, and rid in a Buff-coat with many tall Fellows following me; I anſwered, That my fate had not been ſo hitherto, but I verily believed that my mind and courage was as high, and as prompt to embrace ſuch a deſign, as ſome others, but that the vigour of my youth was paſt many years before that occaſion preſented it ſelf: Then they replied, that if I had
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51849:54"/> not been in actual Armes againſt the Parliament, as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it, then there was a Proviſo in the Act for Sale that might do me ſome good, and ſo in a civill ſort they departed from me; and it is very probable, that this miſchief was haſtned upon me by the practiſe of the Sequeſtrators, who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friendſhip unto me, but intended otherwiſe; for although the Aſſeſſements were paid in the Country, yet they being called upon for the Rents of my Land above, and being alſo aſhamed, as I think, (after ſuch horrible wrongs as I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſuffered) again to take away that little ſtock which I had ſo hardly gotten together, did therefore to ſalve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, return into their Office above, that I was Lunatick, and that all my Lands lay waſte; and ſure it is there was ſome ſubtle drift, and villanous intention towards me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; but the prime of their Trade was to invent lyes, for the ruine and diſgrace of honeſt men, that oppoſed the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their doings. And now there was no remedy, but to <hi>London</hi> I muſt travell, where I had not been for many years before, for at the firſt beginning of the Rebellion, I did whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give over my practiſe there, deſerted my Chamber, and could not endure to be ſeen amongſt them; yet now I muſt venture again, or looſe all my Eſtate for the preſent, and alaſs I knew not the face of any of thoſe men that I was then enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make my application unto, yet the Providence of God did bring me into ſome little acquaintance with one of the Commiſſioners at <hi>Haberdaſhers Hall,</hi> who was in ſhew a moderate man, and had ſome power and influence among the reſidue, and by his means after long waiting and expence of money, I obtained a hearing of my caſe, where none of them ſeemed to be ſo much an Enemy againſt me, as one that was of mine own profeſſion, but his expreſſions there had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle affinity either with Law or Conſcienoe, and the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of this my hearing, was to referre my caſe back again to the rigorous Rump of that unlucky Parliament, and then I thought my ſelf to be in as bad, or a worſe condition then I was before, and yet ſtill I deſired to put my truſt in God, by whoſe mercy I did continually meet with many comforts; and thus home <hi>I</hi> came again to mine own houſe, where <hi>I</hi> had not continued a week, but <hi>I</hi> heard newes that the Rump was turn'd out of doors by the Souldiery, and indeed <hi>I</hi> did
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51849:55"/> not grieve much at it, but took the ſame for a good <hi>Omen,</hi> that ſuch hideous Beaſtials began to kick and ſcratch ſo ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one at another, and ſome hope I did entertain, that now the Rump was ſo diſpatched, we ſhould reſt in the better quiet; but not long after there came unto me an Agent for the State, as he term'd himſelf, and he ſaid that his Errand was to take an Inventory of all the Goods which were in my poſſeſſion, that ſo they might be forth-comming and reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the uſe of the State. I did know this party well, and ſaid unto him, Your Parliament is now quite out of date, and ſhall theſe oppreſſions continue ſtill? And he anſwered, That there was yet a Council of State, and that matters would paſſe on in the ſame manner as they did before: Well, ſaid I, the will of God muſt take place, and I am heartily ſorry to ſee thee employed upon ſuch an occaſion; Then he anſwered me again, that he muſt do thoſe things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to his Office; Why quoth I, if Satan ſends thee upon a Meſſage, art thou ſo fit for his turn to run pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently? Alas Friend, ſaid I then to him, I did know thy Father, and he was an honeſt and a Zealous Preacher in this Country, and if he were now living, I believe he would more willingly ſee thee come to a ſhamefull end, then ſend thee on ſuch an errand as thou now commeſt about, whereat he hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down his head and looked ill favouredly, yet did his work, and ſo departed with cold entertainment; With many ſuch Meſſages and ſeverall ſummons to appear and to pay rent for mine own Land, I was divers times after ſore vexed and put to much trouble and charge: But at length by Gods mercy, and the meanes of one Mr. <hi>Jannyſon</hi> of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> an old Sea Captain, that had antient acquaintance with one Mr. <hi>Winſlow</hi> a Commiſſioner for the compounding of Sequeſtrations, and did freely alſo without my ſeeking, moſt friendly offer me his Love and Service in that behalf; I obtained after long ſuit, and twice paying for it, a full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from that Office: and who would not think, but that I had then been ſafe enough from that danger? and yet my <hi>Genius</hi> did ſtill miſdoubt the worſt, and could never be truly apprehenſive of Security, ſo long as ſuch Hypocrites were in Power, as made the pretence of Religion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, a Cloak to cover all their Villany and Oppreſſion;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51849:55"/> And ſo unhappily it fell out, that I took not my marks amiſs, for notwithſtanding my diſcharge aforeſaid, being as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat as they could make any, yet ſtill I was called upon to bring in the Arrearages of Rents for my Lands, that were due to the State forſooth as they pretended, and when this my diſcharge was ſhewed ſorth, and pleaded in the Country before their Auditors and Receivers, they could take very little or no exceptions againſt it, only they ſaid that the Rents and Profits of my Lands would ſtill be called in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neither could they ſurceaſe or forbear ſo doing, untill ſuch time as my ſaid diſcharges were ſent up, and inrolled before the Commiſſioners at <hi>Worceſter</hi> houſe: And hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſelf being then in Priſon, by force and colour of their unjuſt power, I was enforced to procure a Friend, to convey it up thither, where inſtead of inrolling of the fame, they took it quite away from me, and left me only a Copy thereof, that one of my Sons had formerly written out: and afterwards when the <hi>Rump</hi> recovered their peeviſh power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, they made a ſale and graunt of all my Eſtate, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the diſcharge which I had ſo hardly obtained, and all the wofull miſeries, that they and their fore-runners had formerly ſo long impoſed upon me, and my poor Family, only in the deſpite of our Loyall Faithfullneſs to his late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and becauſe we refuſed to paſſe in the rank of Rebells: Such was the Charity and Juſtice of theſe wretched Miſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and yet for all their raging and prodigious projects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, we had the good hapand courage to keep the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of our houſe, during all the time of the late diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and this I think may be put in Chronicle for a kind of Miracle, and if I ſhould make a punctuall Relation of all the Travels and Troubles, that we endured and paſſed thorough, in and about this laſt recited affliction of ours, it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a large volume of it ſelf: And yet I was as much vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and tormented with another Hobgoblin hatcht in Hell, but called an Engagement, and for the Non-ſubſcribing of this, I was reputed an out-law, and no man that owed me any thing, would pay me a penny (unleſſe it were ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious ſoul that feared God) for they knew that I was diſabled, to bring any action againſt them: And beſides I had openly declared divers times, that I would hazard to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51849:56"/> ſtarve, before that I would ſeek the help and relief of ſuch Law-leſſe Authority as was then in uſe; And hereupon ſome perverſe and ignorant Wretches did deride me, and were the more prompt to work me a miſchief, and ſticked not to ſay, that if any man killed me, there was no pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment to be inflicted for ſo doing; Neither could <hi>I</hi> be permitted to plead ſo much as in a Corporation Court, and upon this ſad occaſion, <hi>I</hi> continued cloſe and retired at home for a good while, being loth to expoſe my ſelf to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace or danger as the violence of the ſtream did then run, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Not long after this I was ſummoned up to be decimated, and there it was ordered again, that I ſhould

But notwithſtanding all theſe my Troubles and Perplexities, or their pretences of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towards me, yet I could never be drawn or daunted from the defence of the truth, and the bold and free utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of my mind therein, upon every fit occaſion. Once as I was pleading in a Court for my Client, the cheif Magiſtrate there, and my ſelf began to claſh a little, whereupon I chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſay, that ſome courſes would never be left, untill the Kingdome were quite undone, to which, he anſwered me thus, you to be ſure will be undone in the mean time, whereat I clapped my hand upon my Breaſt, and ſaid, Gods will be fullfilled, but if I be undone, yet I ſhall have an advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſome others, for I ſhall fall with Majeſty, and a good Conſcience, and that too many will miſs of, at which ſome of the ſtanders by were not diſpleaſed, for I heard them whiſper and ſay, here is a man of a rare Spirit. And when I was in the deepeſt danger for the ſale of my Lands, this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate laſt mentioned, had a Son that was intereſſed about Sequeſtrations and Sales, and I remembred that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had taken hold of the Law of an Heathen Emperour to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the laſh, and ſo I thought it lawfull for me to uſe the beſt means I could, to preſerve my Wife and Children, from being turned out of doors: To this man therefore I repaired, and deſired him to ſpeak to his Son on my behalf, and he preſently called for his Son, and charged him before my face, to ſhew me all the curteſie and ſervice that lay in his power, and then the old man and I walked together into the Fields, where being in diſcourſe, he ſaid that he was ſorry that it was ſo with me, for if you quoth he, would have gone the way that other Learned men did, you ſhould never have had need to crave a curteſie at any mans hand, for you might have been able to do favours for all your Friends and acquaintance, for you might have been a man of great rule and command in the Country, and gotten what
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51849:57"/> Eſtate you had pleaſed; Yes ſure, was my Anſwer, I might have got the Devil and all; Then replyed he to me, you will never leave theſe manner of expreſſions, but they do you no good; Yes ſaid I, there will be a time when the ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of truth may ſtand me in ſome ſted; and Sir, ſaid I, you muſt give me leave to tell you, that if I had gone otherwiſe then I have done, I had been as arrant a ſtinking Knave as ever piſſed againſt a Wall; whereat the man ſtarted, and ſaid, why I hope you will not ſay that we are all ſo: No ſure, ſaid I, my modeſty will not ſuffer me to tell you on it ſo plainly, but my ſelf had been ſo howſoever; And why you quoth he, more then other men? The reaſon, ſaid I, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, for I had then gone againſt my Conſcience in point of Religion, and my Judgement in point of Law, and he that doeth ſo, I ſay is an arrant Knave: But Conſcience, ſaid he, muſt be rectified; Very true, ſaid I, but how? it muſt be rectified indeed by the Law of God and Man, and not by the opinions and humours of a few factious Schiſmaticks. This man had been a Magiſtrate near 30<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> years, and I believed that the ſtream of the Times, rather then the ſtrength of his Judgement, had now cauſed him to run the courſe he did, and therefore I think that I gave his Worſhip ſuch a peſtilent rub as he had ſeldome met withall before, but my intent therein was to do him good. In the late Tyrants time, an Attorney told me of a Lawyer which I knew, that was then called up to be a Judge in one of the Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> whereunto I anſwered, that I was ſorry for him becauſe I feared that he had forgot both his Law and Religion too, but alaſſe ſaid I, the pride of the heart is ſo great, that ſome will hunt after, and accept of preferment, although it be upon never ſo evil termes, but ſure ſuch men are quite out of their wits: I wonder you will ſay ſo, ſaid he, why if the Protector ſhould ſend you a Commiſſion to be a Judge, would you not accept of it? no ſurely, ſaid I, and verily I hope that thou haſt not ſo bad a conceit on me, as to believe that I would once entertain ſuch an offer; and though I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the old Adage, which ſaith, That he that ſpeaks the truth may have his head broken, yet I proceeded on fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſaid, that I ſhould rather chuſe to dye at mine own Gate, then take a place under ſuch a power, for if ever I be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51849:58"/> either Judge or Juſtice, I hope at ſhall be in Gods name, and not in the Devils, for all Rebells are of the Devil, and only from him they had their firſt original.

Why quoth he, I hope you will tarry and dine with the Juſtices: no ſurely ſaid I, for ſuch doctrine I have already heard amongſt them, as I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved neither to eat nor drink with them this day: But I hope now ſuch popular Temporiſers will truly ſee their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, ere it be too late, for every ſuch <hi>Proteus</hi> or <hi>Protogenes</hi> that intends to participate of Eternal felicity, and to be as well capable of Gods mercy, as of their Princes pardon, muſt not think it ſufficient to turn a new leaf with the times, but they muſt be ſeriouſly ſorrowfull, and repentant for their former failings, and corrupt converſations: One of the holy Fathers uſed to pray unto God to forgive him his other mens ſins, that is, the ſins which he had occaſioned others to fall into and commit; and moſt heartily I do beſeech Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that the whole body of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 words">

And yet whoſoever in the late times, durſt but once open his mouth, to ſpeak againſt ſuch ethnical practiſes, was preſently branded with the odious name of a Malignant, &amp; ill affected perſon to the ſtate: but if all had been ſo blockiſh as to be ſilent, and not have ſpoken a word againſt ſuch damnable doings, I think (as our Saviour ſaith in another caſe) the very ſtones would have cried out: &amp; although too many were much offended at thoſe that ſpake their minds in ſinceritie, yet I beleeve it was happie for the whole Nation that there were ſome ſuch perſons to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at, for had there been no righteous <hi>Lots</hi> therein to reprove the wickedneſſe of others, and that were continually vexed with the unjuſt converſation of ſuch <hi>Sodomites,</hi> there might have been danger enough for fire and brimſtone to have fallen from Heaven, upon ſuch a groſſe apoſtatizing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; for I am ſure that the ſinnes of <hi>Sodome</hi> never moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo high, nor cried ſo loud in the ears of Gods venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as the bewitched wickedneſſe of wretched <hi>England</hi> for many years of late hath certainly done, the Lord in his Chriſt be mercifully appeaſed with us for the ſame.

Such prodigious devices were not in uſe, untill the old dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon begun to rage, becauſe his time waxed ſhort: but all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the primitive times, notwithſtanding thoſe bloudie, heavie and horrible perſecutions impoſed upon Chriſtians: yet thoſe that were true godly Saints, did never ſo much as dream of rebelling againſt their Governours, for ever ſtill in their ſtrongeſt extremities, their ſharpeſt weapons were <hi>preces &amp; lachrimae,</hi> a ſure ſymboll of a ſacred heart: but all violent courſes to protect themſelves, they utterly diſclaimed. There is a generation yet amongſt us, that can never be ſo ſoundly ſenſible of their ſouls ſolace as they might be, if they were truly convinced of their late errors, and ſeriouſly ſorrowfull and humbled for their former offences: but ſo long as they meet with pardon and preferment, they think all is well, but alas it is not ſo, for too many ſtill fare the worſe for theſe mens late unjuſt and impious practiſes: I wiſh them to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that God is a righteous Judge, and will render juſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in due time; for oppreſſion will ever cry to heaven for vengeance: there be many matters which they have had a ſhrewd hand in, that will be a bitter blemiſh in their armes, as long as they live: and as the vulgar ſaying is, may grieve them in their graves when they be dead, or at leaſt ſtick ſore at their ſouls hereafter, if they bring not forth better fruits and effects of true repentance, then can hitherto be ſeen or perceived in them by an impartial eye: <hi>Such as ſeek to cover their ſinnes cannot proſper:</hi> and ſome there be I fear, whoſe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer faults being now ſhadowed under a fair pretext, do ſtill by their connivancie and countenance encourage others to be more ſtubborn and refractorie in the yeelding unto, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance

In truth it is now time, under royal favour, if it ſo pleaſe God and your Majeſty, that your Graces poor ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friends ſhould be a little looked upon, and conſidered of, who have been ſo couragiouſly conſtant in their ſaddeſt ſufferings, abhorring to defile themſelves, with the leaſt tincture of Treaſon, but alwayes labouring to imprint Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty in the hearts of others; and frequently and faithfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their beſt faculties for your Majeſties ſervice, and the good of their native Country. Some of my Oppoſites have ſaid unto me, that they believed it was impoſſible to turn me from the way, that I walked in, and that although they were not of my mind, and that I was their enemy, and did them more hurt in their Cauſe, than many that fought againſt it, yet they could not chuſe but honor the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of me, in regard that I had ever ſtood ſo ſtoutly to my Principles. It was truly ſaid of the Wiſeman, that when a man is well proved, then is his faithfullneſs known; and certainly I may ſay to your Majeſty with a ſafe conſcience, that in the time of the late Anarchy, my fidelity to your Grace, was ſufficiently tryed to the proof, for amongſt all the revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

Some factious and ſeditious Ignorants, would now and then be carping at your Majeſties title to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and affirm that it came in firſt by <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, and being gotten by Conqueſt, it might as well in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be loſt: but my anſwer to this was, that the Caſe is not the ſame, for <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour was a forein Prince, and by the law of Armes might make a Conqueſt of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but no Subjects can ever conquer their Soveraign; for although they do over-powre him by force and violence, yet that is no Conqueſt, but a meer act of rebellion, and no wayes juſtifiable either by the laws of God or man: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides I commonly ſaid unto them, that if any of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors had been ſei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

On a time being at a Court Baron in a great and populous Town, divers of the Tenants there in open diſcourſe, did ask me many Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions in Law, which I gave them my Opinion in to their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction: at the length a jolly fellow there, who was a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters lay elder, did ſay, that the tenants were much beholding to me, for I had told them a great deal of Law; but, quoth he, I have heard but little Goſpel come from you. Friend, ſaid I, thanks be given to God for it, I can ſpeak Goſpel too as well as Law, but Goſpel now is not fit for your hearing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have caſt off the practiſe of it. No, ſure, ſaid he, I do make more account of the Goſpel, than of your Law. You ought indeed to do ſo, ſaid I, but you have forgot your Dutie then; for the Goſpel enjoynes you to give <hi>Caeſar</hi> his due, and that you have quite forgotten, and where are you now? Then I deſired him to tell me, Whether he thought that St. <hi>Peters</hi> Epiſtles were Canonical Scripture or not? Yes, quoth he, they are. Then, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> there you fail again, for there is in them a good Document, that you and others have ſlighted moſt ſhamefully. What is that? ſaid he. It is this, ſaid <hi>I, Fear God, and honour the King,</hi> and that <hi>I</hi> am ſure you have quite forgotten, or little regarded theſe two ſeven years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hereat the whole Auditorie fell into a loud laughter, and the Elder knew not what to ſay for himſelf. There was a rich Town not far from me, which at the firſt beginning of the late Rebellion, were liberal and very free to part with their
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51849:61"/> Monies and Armes to that purpoſe, but their Purſes being prettily well exhauſted, and ſome of them not well willing, or able to ſpare any more Monie out of their Stocks, for the preſent; yet for a further oſtentation, and to make their Zeal and Devotion, though blinde in it ſelf, yet perſpicuous and clear enough unto others: They conſulted therefore, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed together to borrow 1000 pound upon intereſt of a rich Uſurer, and preſently they lent the ſame to the Parliament, upon the Publick Faith, though alaſs they knew not where that Utopian or imaginarie Creature did then dwell, neither from that day to this could they ever find out the reſidence thereof, nor yet ſo happily meet with it, as to get their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies again. It was my chance a few years after to enter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with one of the moſt ſolid Heads in that Pariſh, and <hi>I</hi> ſaid unto him, that <hi>I</hi> had ſeldom or never read or heard of ſuch a ſtupified, and blockiſh kind of people as moſt of them were. Why, quoth he, are we worſe then all others? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> there be none that <hi>I</hi> know of, that have manifeſted more ignorance and perverſeneſs than you have done; for when you had parted with all, and lent to the Rebels ſo much Monie of your own, as you liſted to ſpare, then muſt you forſooth take up Monie at intereſt, to ſend the ſame way; and ſo purchaſe to your ſelves a ſtronger Title to the Triple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, for that will be your portion in the end, if you meet not with the more mercy: and was there ever known any people ſo ſottiſh, as to borrow Monie upon uſe, to drive ſuch a dangerous Trade; certainly a man that is not worſe then mad, would have had ſo much Monie as he knew not what to do withall, before that ever he durſt have ventured to lay it out upon ſo poor an advantage, as to buy himſelf a Bargain of ſuch dead and deſperate Ware. Indeed <hi>I</hi> believe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the Wrongs and Indignities, that were put upon me, and too tedious here to be related, there was nothing ſo much perplexive and vexatious unto me, as to ſee my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country-men ſo readily run on to their own ruine, and to be ſo ſecure and confident in the wayes of Error and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: but ſtill I told them, that Security was the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Danger; that they walked upon deceitfull grounds; for ſo ſoon as the Winde turned, their falſe Teachers would

And yet allwayes when I took an occaſion to declare my ſtrong hopes, of your Majeſties Reſtauration, many would ſeem to laugh at it, and wiſh me to ſet my heart at reſt, for <hi>I</hi> ſhould never live to ſee that day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to which I ever replied with a conſtant courage, that I truſted in God to live and ſee that happy day which I had ſo much prayed for, and ſo long expected, and continually hoped for ſo many years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and that their ſecurity was a ſign, and ſtrong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to me of the more ſudden approach thereof, for it would certainly come to paſſe when the moſt of men did leaſt dream of it; and a time of the weakeſt probability in the eye of the world, is the fitteſt ſeaſon for the Divine ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and the moſt glorious opportunity for God Almighty to bring his own purpoſes, and bleſſed decrees to the beſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: for it was impoſſible for a real and true Chriſtian to beleeve, that the divine juſtice could any longer ſuffer ſuch uſurping wretchedneſſe to have continuance, which had ſo baſely and injuriouſly ſubverted the whole frame of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both in Church and Commonwealth, ſetting up ſuch pandariſing Magiſtrates as were content to ſubmit themſelves to be agents in the moſt heatheniſh and Mahometan abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and ſuch idolatrizing Miniſters, as for <hi>Balaams</hi> wages were content to idolize every uſurping rebell, and perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and perjuriouſly to defame, and caſt off the Hierarchie of the Church, which they had formerly ſworn to maintain, and yeeld their obedience unto, and ſtubbor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that it would do me no great hurt, but a friend of his had earneſtly enjoyned him to tell me of it, and to hear my anſwer thereunto: Well Sir, ſaid I, what is the matter I pray?

Why ſaid he, this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that intreated me to do this Errand, hath laid out mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies about the Purchaſing of your Land, and I think that he would willingly learn how he may come in to his monies again: Yes marry, ſaid I, that were well, for as yet there is a Fool and his money ſoon parted, for if it be laid out upon ſuch termes as you do intimate, then your friend if he meets with his lawfull and due deſert, may very fairly totter for his pains; for in truth had there not been ſuch ſottiſh and covetous Contractors, for the purchaſing of honeſt mens Eſtates, there had never been ſuch unjuſt and impious wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as would once have offered to make Sales of the ſame; But I pray tell me, ſaid I, who is this your friend that hath made ſuch a blind bargain for himſelf? he is, ſaid the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, a Barriſter at Law, and hath a place in the preſent Parliament, and he hath ſent down Letters of Attorney to one here in the Country, to demand the Rents of your Lands, and to fore-warn your Tenants from paying you any more Rent; Indeed ſaid I, he is a pretty Lawyer, and hath proceeded well; doth not he deſerve to be degraded, or worſe, that thinks Gentlemen can forfeit their Eſtates for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to be Traytors? the Law tells him, That it is the committing of Treaſon, and not the diſclaiming or refuſall thereof, that brings men within compaſſe of the forfeiture either of their Lives or Eſtates, and therefore ſurely his Learning in the Law, or rather ignorance therein, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve far more puniſhment, then preſerment: Yet truly, quoth the Gentleman, he is an honeſt man, and was drawn in to lend money, and to obtain the ſame again, he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and enforced to take a grant of your Lands, but he deſires to do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ou no wrong, but will gladly accept of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable compoſition: Then I asked him, how much money his friend had disburſed about the bargain, and his anſwer
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51849:65"/> was with a ſpecification of many hundred pounds: Well, I am ſorry for him, ſaid I, for the truth is, that I will never give him ſo much as the skin of a Lowſe, and I much mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell that any man now dares be ſo impudent as to talk of any Rump buſineſſes, conſidering that we hope the Kings Majeſty will be amongſt us, ere it be long: Yes, it may be ſo, ſaid he, if this Parliament will allow of him: They allow of him, ſaid I, why is that the chief point to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? I truſt theſe will approve themſelves to be wiſer then ſome of their Predeceſſors, or elſe they muſt look to find the like fortune, for his Majeſties Motto is, <hi>Dieu &amp; mon Droit,</hi> and that in Gods good time will bring him to his Crown, in ſpite of all oppoſition: Thus I ſo lectured my Gentleman, that he much commended of my reſolution and diſcourſe, and ſaid that he was of my mind, and ſo we parted in a very friendly manner. And yet theſe and other numerous pranks of the like nature, that for ſo long a time together have been played upon me, were ſufficient to penetrate the patience of a more patient, and leſſe paſſionate man then my ſelf, but it pleaſed God to make me remember, <hi>Qui patitur vincit, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia ſola triumphat.</hi> And I moſt humbly beſeech your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to believe, and be confident, that all your Loyal and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Subjects, that have been conſtant ſufferers in the late unhappy times, will never in the leaſt degree go about to nouriſh or flatter themſelves in the repining againſt that which is your Majeſties good will and pleaſure, for we are well content ſtill to endure any thing that may truly tend to your Majeſties ſafety and advantage; and we do fervently deſire, and inceſſantly invocate the Almighty Majeſty of Heaven, in whoſe hands the hearts of Kings are, that he will be pleaſed in his abundant mercy and goodneſſe, ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to direct and diſpoſe of your Majeſties Councils and Affairs, as may be moſt requiſite and pliant to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his bleſſed will, revealed in his word; and for the maintenance and upholding of the true Doctrine and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Orthodox Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the ſame was ſetled and eſtabliſhed at the Reformation thereof, by regal lawfull Authority: And I doubt not but that your Majeſtie is well pleaſed with us, in theſe our good deſires; for alas it is too manifeſt, that the late counterfeit, though ſpecious
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51849:66"/> ſhew of Reformation, and the crying down of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government was a great inſtrument to beget and breed up that furious and giddy generation of Sciſmaticks, that have ſo long troubled, and almoſt confounded the whole Nation. And it is to be feared, that ſome will think it now ſcarce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to diſtributive Juſtice, that ſuch as have been ſo much hindred and almoſt undone for their Loyalty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the late times, ſhould ſtill be oppreſſed in their Purſes, to help to beare out other Mens miſpriſions, and perverſities: or that conſtant Loyaltie, and his inveterate oppoſite and antagoniſt, though in a changeable coloured Coat, ſhould yet walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in aequipage, and be equivalent in countenance, and reſpect; And yet notwithſtanding we are content, and do rejoyce only in ſubmitting to your Majeſties good will and pleaſure therein; and though perhaps for ſome ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of State, not yet well known or apprehended by us, we are at preſent debarred from ſomething, which the benefit of the Law, our birth-right, might very fairly have afforded us, yet we gain this honour and ſatisfaction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that it is now manifeſt to all the world, that can ſee, and will not be wilfully blind, that all the Rapines, Wrongs and Oppreſſions, ſo lately impoſed upon us, were utterly illegal, and that we had a good and juſt right of recompence for the ſame, both in point of Law, Equity, Reaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and eſpecially ſuch of us, as had been conſtantly loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and wrought no detriment to others; or elſe to what purpoſe was there any new Law made to deprive us, but <hi>pro tempore,</hi> of that legal Legacy, and inherent Inheritance, which the great Charter of <hi>England,</hi> the continued will of ſo many famous Kings and Parliaments, for ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years had in lawfull manner bequeathed to our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and in them to us, and our Poſterities. But I touch not upon this ſtring to any other end or intent, then only to reſtifie, how I do believe that ſome others as well as my ſelf have met with occaſion clad or dreſſed in a more diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed habit, then was expected, for none of us, are ſo deficient in underſtanding, but that we are apprehenſive enough, not only of the greatneſſe of the grievances we have endured, but alſo of the ſmallneſſe of the regard, and countenance, which at ſome mens hands we have received for the ſame:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51849:66"/> and yet as we cannot but be ſorely ſenſible of our Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſlightings, and the ſlender notice that is taken thereof: So we will not at any time be emulous to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the right of our deſires, not ſo much as in thought, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than the correſpondent good will and pleaſure of your Sacred Majeſty, and the known Laws authoriſed by the ſame, ſhall give us free liberty and we are ſufficiently confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that upon the true reſenting of our Loyalty and Loſſes, and the due conſideration of the nature, and of other paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges thereupon, now ſo faſt knit to our Obedience, your roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Majeſty will ſoon conceive, that in point of honour and conſcience, your Grace is the more engaged to look upon us, and without that favourable aſpect, we not only fear, but find it too evidently hitherto for a truth, that the Chame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of this age, who feed upon the Utopian aire of their own frothy inventions and conceits, will never come near us, and ſo be adapted to turn themſelves into our colours and conſtitution, but rather with reproach abandon us, and ſo totally deprive themſelves of that good, which our Councell and Converſation might miniſter amongſt them: and were it not great pitty, that ſo worthy Qualities and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties as Loyalty, and Courage, ſhould unhappily prove and become the Uſhers in of Obloquy and Contempt; or that ſo rare and precious a priſe as Vertue, for want of a few external Ornaments and Additaments, ſhould be in the leaſt danger to be deſpiſed in its own Country, or Family. In truth for my own part I have had the tryal, to meet with more abuſes, and ſarcaſmical ſcoffs of late, then I intend to regard, or mean to mention; but as touching any kindneſſe, favour or furtherance to refreſh me, after my long oppreſſed and indigent Condition, I can gather up that but very thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, although there is as much reaſon for me now to expect practiſe, and as much faithfull induſtry, and ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my undertakings, as there is in ſome others, that reap a more plentifull harveſt of their endeavours, yet there is ſuch an antipathy between moſt of the Country, where I live, and ſome of my beſt Qualities, as the greateſt part of the people are much averſe to be acquainted with me, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring how ſharply in former times I did reprove their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,

            <p>The King of <hi>England,</hi> is an abſolute Imperiall Monarch by the Law, yet he is to govern his Subjects by the Laws and Antient Cuſtomes of his Kingdome; But the King is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupreme Power next under God, and ſo acknowledged by all Parliaments, and the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance do prove as much; And by a Statute made in 1 of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> any man is diſabled to ſit as a Member in the houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, untill he hath taken a ſolemn Oath upon the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, whereby he doth acknowledge the King to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supreme Governour of theſe Realmes in all Caſes whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; And alſo promiſeth, that he will to the beſt of his Power, aſſiſt, and defend, all his Majeſties Royal Priviledges, Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51849:69"/> Imperiall Crown, and yield his Obedience thereunto. Which Oath how faithfully ſome do now obſerve, I leave to the Judgement of God, and their own Conſciences.</p>
            <p>It is confeſſed by all knowing men, that a Parliament truly underſtood, is a Court of the higheſt Nature, and Authority in this Kingdome, and that it hath power to make and alter Lawes: And that matters there in queſtion are to be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or agreed on by the Major part of Voices; But it muſt not be a Parliament without a Head, not a Parliament rent in pieces, that hath power to do this: For to make any Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory Act to bind the Subject abſolutely, either in Life, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, or Goods, there muſt be a concurrence of the Major part of both Houſes, with the Kings Royall Aſſent added thereunto, in whom the Legiſlative power doth alone conſiſt; And therefore I know not how any ſuch thing can now be done at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the King being abſent, and the farr greater part of both houſes, nay almoſt all the Lords, being alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and now joyning themſelves with the King in all his deſignes.</p>
            <p>But it will be objected, that many things may be done by Ordinance of Parliament; I will not deny, but that both Houſes of Parliament joyntly aſſembled, may poſſibly have power to make Ordinances, for the preſent good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth; And that theſe Ordinances may be binding, during the time of that Seſſion: Provided, that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e no wayes contradictory to the known Laws of the Land; For the Subject enjoyeth his Life, his Liberty, his Lands, by the antient Cuſtomes and Statutes of this Kingdome, which are indeed the fundamentall Lawes thereof: And therefore the Subject cannot be deprived of theſe rights, but by a Law of as high a nature, and that muſt be a Statute Law at the leaſt: How then can any man by an Ordinance contradictory to Law, be legally diſpoſſeſſed of his Liberty, or Goods, which he doth enjoy by the Power of the Law: But ſome ſay that theſe things may be done by Priviledge of Parliament; And if there be ſuch a Priviledge come to light, that doth over-top all Law, Reaſon, and Religion, then much may be done. But I beeleeve that if any ſuch Priviledge be now found out, that it is as new as the inventers thereof, for venerable antiquity:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51849:70"/> their betters in learning and knowledge, never yet heard of any ſuch matter:</p>
            <p>It is known to all that have but ſmelt of the Law, that both by the Common and Statutes Lawes of this Kingdome, it is high Treaſon to levie Armes againſt the King, or to be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, or Aſſiſtant to the Kings Enemies, and theſe Laws, when they be once again armed with power, will have a very large conſtruction by the Judges of the Law.</p>
            <p>There is a Parliament to be found in hiſtorie that did ſeem to wage warr againſt a King in this Realm, but what ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe it had, I had rather the Hiſtorian ſhould tell you then my ſelf: ſure I am, there is an ignominious brand laid upon is to all poſterity, for it is ſtill ſtiled <hi>Parliamentum inſanum.</hi>

            <p>It is moſt true, that the King and many of his true Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are much abuſed, for truth is hid in darkneſſe, and it is the miſery of miſeries that men are ſo wilfully blinded and beſotted, as their eares are ſtopped to all good Counſell: Wiſe men that know the truth of things, are much diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to impart the ſame to others, becauſe they ſee many are ſo wedded to their wilfull Errours, that he which in charity goes about to adviſe them for the beſt, may ſooner himſelf fall into a ſnare for his good will, then pull any of them out of the danger that hangs over their heads: for he that now a dayes dares venture to ſpeak the truth, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſnapt at for a Malignant.
